# OmniPoly

Welcome to **OmniPoly**! This project is a comprehensive solution for translation and language enhancement. It integrates:

## Key Features
- Translation: Text translation across multiple languages (see: [libretranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate)).
- Grammar Checking: Ensures your text is not only translated but also reads well with proper grammar and style (see: [languagetool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool)).
- AI-Powered Insights: Utilizes Large Language Models to analyze sentiments and extract interesting sentences, adding depth to your translations (see: [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)).

The project started because I wasn't satisfied with the standard app that comes with Libre Translate (it didn't remember my previous choices). I decided to create my own solution. Eventually, I discovered self-hosted LanguageTool and learned that it lacked a frontend interface.

## How to Run with Docker

The most recommended way to start it up is to use Docker.

### Sample Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
services:
  omnipoly:
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      LANGUAGE_TOOL: https://your.languagetool.instance
      # if you want to enable picky mode in languagetool
      LANGUAGE_TOOL_PICKY: true
      LIBRETRANSLATE: https://your.libretranslate.instance
      LIBRETRANSLATE_API_KEY: 'your_API_key' # use if your instance requires API key
      OLLAMA: https://your.ollama.instance
      OLLAMA_MODEL: model_name
      # pick one of: 'pole' | 'light' | 'dark' 
      THEME: 'dark'
      # To limit language options for translations provide an array of ISO 639 language codes
      LIBRETRANSLATE_LANGUAGES: ["pl","en"] # optional
      # To limit language options for text check provide an array of long tags (ISO 639/ISO-3166) also known as language-Region code.
      LANGUAGE_TOOL_LANGUAGES: ["pl-PL","en-GB"] # optional
      # To disable "add word" to dicationary
      DISABLE_DICTIONARY: true # optional
      DEBUG: false # set to true to log text sent to tools and it's raw responses
    ports:
      - 80:80
    image: kweg/omnipoly:latest
```

### Disabling Specific Systems

If you prefer not to use any of the following systems—AI, LanguageTool, or LibreTranslate—for any reason, you can easily disable them by omitting their respective environment variables during configuration.

The project is designed in such a way that it will not display features that are unconfigured. This means if an environment variable for a particular system is not provided, the corresponding feature will be automatically hidden from view and will not be available for use.

### On running backends

#### Libre translate

```yaml
services:
  libretranslate:
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - host=your.libretranslate.instance
    image: libretranslate/libretranslate
```

#### Language tool

```yaml
services:
  languagetool:
    image: meyay/languagetool:latest
    container_name: languagetool
    restart: unless-stopped
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:exec
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - CAP_CHOWN
      - CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
      - CAP_SETUID
      - CAP_SETGID
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
    environment:
      MAP_UID: 783
      MAP_GID: 783
    volumes:
      - ~/ngrams:/ngrams
      - ~/fasttext:/fasttext
```

## Running and Building Locally

To run OmniPoly locally, follow these steps:

1. Copy `.env.sample` as `.env`
2. Fill in all fields and add `DEV=true`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`
5. The app should be served at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)

> **Note**: The application can also be accessed at the ports mentioned in the runtime information: [http://localhost:54427](http://localhost:54427) or [http://localhost:57175](http://localhost:57175).

## Roadmap

- Text workflow - The goal is to have a feeling of single text input across all modules. So we can translate and adjust the same text.
  - ability to switch between translated text and input text in language tool
  - AI tab to prompt AI to modify the input/translated text
  - Sample flow (goal is to be able to follow any order multiple times) - type email in language A -> translate it to language B -> adjust text with help of AI (i.e. "make it more official") -> verify grammar
